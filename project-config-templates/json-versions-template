# This is version update helper config.
# It contains specific to current project variables. With use of this file vuh understands how to extract project's
# version and where project's version variable is located. Vuh can't work with any project without this file!
# If vuh.conf file located in comparing branch is different from local vuh.conf file vuh will by default take
# configuration files from handling branches (f.e. local vuh.conf to work with local version and origin/main:vuh.conf
# to work with origin/main's version). If your project dont have vuh.conf file in project's root folder vuh will advice
# you to configure that project.
