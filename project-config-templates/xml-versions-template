# This is version update helper config.
# It contains specific to current project variables. With use of this file vuh understands how to extract project's
# version and where project's version variable is located. Vuh can't work with any project without this file!
# If .vuh file located in comparing branch is different from local .vuh file vuh will by default take
# configuration files from handling branches (f.e. local .vuh to work with local version and origin/main:.vuh
# to work with origin/main's version). If your project dont have .vuh file in project's root folder vuh will advice
# you to configure that project.
#
# (Version update helper's page: https://github.com/Greewil/version-update-helper)

# This configuration file is based on project-config-templates/xml-versions-template.

# MAIN_BRANCH_NAME: the name of the main project's branch
# example: 'main' or 'master'
MAIN_BRANCH_NAME='main'

# VERSION_FILE: file which contains version information (As in current branch so and in origin/MAIN_BRANCH_NAME branch!)
# example: 'package.json' (for node.js application)
VERSION_FILE='pom.xml'

# TEXT_BEFORE_VERSION_CODE: unique text which will be just before version number (including spaces)
# example: '\"version\": \"' (for variable "version" in json files so it can find line "version": "version_number")
TEXT_BEFORE_VERSION_CODE="^    <version>"

# TEXT_AFTER_VERSION_CODE: unique text which will be just after version number (including spaces)
# example: '\",' (for variable "version" in json files so it can find line "version": "version_number")
TEXT_AFTER_VERSION_CODE="<\/version>"

# You can override get_larger_prerelease_info function here. Here's a template for it:
#
# $1 - Prerelease information of the first version to compare
# $2 - Prerelease information of the second version to compare
#
# Returns larger prerelease version or '=' if inputs are treated as equal.
#function get_larger_prerelease_info() {
#  <Your comparing logic>
#}
